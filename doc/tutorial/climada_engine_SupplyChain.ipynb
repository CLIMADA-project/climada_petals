To do this one needs to know what countries and sectors the used exposure represents. \n",

For example, assuming the `LitPop` exposure is representative of the service sector, and assuming that sub-sectors at positions 26 to 56 in `WIOD16` do represent this sector, then one can translate spatially disaggregated impacts into country/sector impacts as follows:"

    "Which creates the attributes `self.secs_exp`, `self.secs_imp`, and `self.secs_shock`. The first two show `Exposure` and `Impact` values at the country-sector level. This translation is accomplished assuming that exposure/impact of an affected sector is proportional to this sector's contribution to the overall production of all affected sectors. For example, if the total (spatially distributed) exposed value is 100, and there are two affected sectors, A (whose production is 2) and B (whose production is 8), then sector A has an exposure of 20 and sector B has an exposure of 80.

    "This practically means that the fraction of *production* losses is assumed to be equal to the fractions of *stock* losses, since `Impact` and `Exposure` typically refer to stocks in CLIMADA. However, since depending on the sector one can reasonably expect production losses to be proportionally higher or lower than stock losses, a `shock_factor` argument can also be passed to define - for each sector - how much should production shocks be higher/lower than stocks shocks (i.e., the mere `Impact` / `Exposure` ratio):"
